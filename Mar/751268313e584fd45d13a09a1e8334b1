Addressing the country about the latest COVID-19 developments, President Cyril Ramaphosa said South Africa has emerged from the second wave.   “New infections, admissions to hospital and deaths have fallen significantly and continue to decline steadily,” President Ramaphosa said on Sunday. The President told the nation that the country recorded just under 10 000 new infections last week.   “A month ago, in the last week of January, the country recorded over 40 000 new cases. And a month before that, in the last week of December, the country recorded close to 90 000 new cases.” He believes that the "dramatic decline" in cases over eight weeks is due to a combination of the public health measures introduced, changes in behaviour and accumulating immunity in those who became infected in our communities.   “We were able to emerge from the second wave because most people adhered to the tighter restrictions and observed the basic health protocols, including wearing masks in public and social distancing,” he added. Due to the decline in infections, he said the country could now ease some of the restrictions on movement and activity under Alert Level 1 lockdown regulations. The World Health Organisation is reporting 113 467 303 confirmed global cases of COVID-19, including 2 520 550 deaths, to date. – SAnews.gov.za
