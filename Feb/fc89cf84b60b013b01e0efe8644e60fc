President Cyril Ramaphosa has expressed his sincere appreciation to the private sector for the R128 million pledge by companies and organised business to help fight the scourge of Gender-Based Violence and Femicide (GBVF) in South Africa. The amount was raised during the launch of Gender-Based Violence and Femicide (GBVF) Response Fund 1 aimed at supporting the implementation of the National Strategic Plan (NSP), and the wider GBVF response in the country. The President launched the fund last week together with the International Women’s Forum of South Africa and social partners. A range of companies participated at the launch and pledged a total of R128 170 000 in contributions to the private-sector led, multi-sectoral fund that will support the implementation of the National Strategic Plan (NSP). The NSP is South Africa’s roadmap to ending GBVF. President Ramaphosa expressed his appreciation for resources from businesses and philanthropies, who are committed to social transformation, and were able to contribute. “This commitment comes at a time of great economic difficulty which itself contributes to the hardship and vulnerability affecting women. It is an important contribution to improving the lives of women and girls in our society. “The successful launch of the fund is a significant demonstration of the depth of social compacting in our society and the vision of a better South Africa shared by social partners,” President Ramaphosa said. The President urged the private sector and philanthropies to support the fund, which will allocate financial support to the programmes that are based on the National Strategic Plan’s six pillars. The six pillars of NSP include accountability, coordination and leadership; prevention and rebuilding social cohesion; justice, safety and protection; response, care, support and healing; economic power; and research and information management.
