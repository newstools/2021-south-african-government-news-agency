Although the 76.2% is a decline of 5.1% from the record pass of 81.3% achieved by the class of 2019, Minister of Basic Education Angie Motshekga said the class of 2020 must be commended for maintaining the trend of above 70%. “The high quality passes we have achieved this year, especially the number of Bachelor and Diploma passes, the overall pass mark, and the passes with distinctions, even in critical subjects, are the hallmarks of the performance of the class of 2020,” Motshekga said.
