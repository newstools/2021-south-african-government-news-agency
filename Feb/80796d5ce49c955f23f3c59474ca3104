The Public Investment Corporation Amendment Act has been promulgated and published in the Government Gazette. This, after it was signed into law by President Cyril Ramaphosa. “[It] provides that the Minister of Finance, as representative of the shareholder, ‘may designate the Deputy Minister of Finance or any Deputy Minister in the economic cluster’ to be appointed as Chairperson of the Board,” said the PIC in a statement on Wednesday. The PIC new Act prescribes how the PIC Board shall be constituted. This will be done in consultation with Cabinet. Other important provisions in the Act to promote transparency in the PIC’s investment processes and decisions, include: PIC chief executive Abel Sithole welcomed the Amendment Act, saying it was a significant step towards greater transparency and accountability regarding the PIC’s investment processes. “Ultimately, the PIC is accountable to its clients and their beneficiaries and to government as shareholder and guarantor of its clients. The new legislation provides for greater oversight by all stakeholders,” Sithole said. The Amended Act empowers the Minister of Finance, as the shareholder representative, to implement the amendments progressively, therefore barring specific directives from the Minister in the near future, the current governance structures and processes continue. – SAnews.gov.za
