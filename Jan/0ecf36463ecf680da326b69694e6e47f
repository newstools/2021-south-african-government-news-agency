Mkhize remembers Mthembu Mkhize has also honoured the late Minister in the Presidency, Jackson Mthembu, who succumbed to COVID-19 on Thursday. “A giant tree has fallen. A communicator par excellence and an even better man. He was always friendly and shall be missed for his kind and generous spirit,” Mkhize said. Mkhize has described Mthembu, who was 62, as someone who had a simple approach to life. “He just wanted to be friendly, helpful and he always wanted everyone to feel special and comfortable around him,” he told eNCA. He recalled how Mthembu was always determined for people to understand what is going on with COVID-19. “He would make sure that no issues are left unattended,” he told the news broadcaster, adding that he wanted people to be informed. “What we will miss is each and every time a regulation is passed or an announcement made by the President. He was the one that would organise a programme after, to inform the people of what is now happening; what has been decided,” he added. He said Mthembu also ensured that government was transparent. “I think that must be one of the things that we keep as a legacy to his memory.” The Health Minister has since sent his deepest love and condolences to the family in this painful time. – SAnews.gov.za
