South Africa’s COVID-19 cases have risen to 1 356 716 after 9 780 patients were confirmed to have contracted the virus on Tuesday. Meanwhile, 839 additional deaths were reported in the last 24 hours, which brings the tally to 38 288 since the outbreak. According to Health Minister, Dr Zweli Mkhize, the high number of deaths is due to data reconciliation as part of the regular auditing process. “This includes the analysis of community data taking into account amongst others, post mortem swabs, backlogged data and unconfirmed outcomes at facilities,” the Minister explained. Of the latest fatalities, 234 occurred in Limpopo, 130 in the Western Cape and 102 in the Eastern Cape. Forty-eight were recorded in Gauteng, 25 in the North West, 20 in Free State, 11 in Mpumalanga and two in the Northern Cape. “We convey our condolences to the loved ones of the departed and thank the health care workers who treated these patients.” In addition, 1 144 857 patients were healed from the respiratory disease, representing a recovery rate of 84%. “The cumulative total of tests conducted to date is 7 700 019 with 46 648 new tests conducted since the last report.” The World Health Organisation (WHO) says there are currently 94 124 612 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 2 034 527 deaths, to date.
