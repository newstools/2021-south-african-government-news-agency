The Presidency said the late Minister Mthembu contributed immensely to the liberation struggle as an anti-apartheid activist, student leader and unionist, for which he was subjected to harassment and detention by the apartheid security forces. He occupied several strategic and leadership roles in the democratic South Africa. He served the African National Congress as its spokesperson from 1995 to 1997 and from 2009 to 2014. He contributed to the development of South Africa’s democratic constitution and served as an MEC in Mpumalanga. He has been a member of the ANC National Executive Committee since 2007 and served as the ANC’s Chief Whip in the National Assembly from 2016 to 2019. Mthembu was appointed as Minister in the Presidency after the 2019 general elections. – SAnews.gov.za
